# Brave Browser


## Overview 

This repository holds the build tools needed to build the Brave desktop browser for macOS, Windows, and Linux.  In particular, it fetches and syncs code from the projects we define in `package.json` and `src/brave/DEPS`:

  - [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)
    - Fetches code via `depot_tools`.
    - sets the branch for Chromium (ex: 65.0.3325.181).
  - [brave-core](https://github.com/brave/brave-core)
    - Mounted at `src/brave`.
    - Maintains patches for 3rd party Chromium code.
  - [brave-extension](https://github.com/brave/brave-extension)
    - Mounted at `src/brave/vendor/brave-extension`.
    - Browser action extension which implements the UI for the shields panel.
  - [ad-block](https://github.com/brave/ad-block)
    - Mounted at `src/brave/vendor/ad-block`.
    - Implements Brave's ad-block engine.
  - [tracking-protection](https://github.com/brave/tracking-protection)
